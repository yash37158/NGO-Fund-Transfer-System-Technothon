## Detailed Explanation of the Idea : 
* Here, we used the Solidity language to create a smart contract. smart-contract are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without an intermediary's involvement or time loss. and the IDE which we have used here is REMIX which is Ethereum's online web application to write, debug and deploy smart contracts efficiently and effectively. We have selected injected web3 as our runtime environment which will connect with metamask test network, MetaMask is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain which is an Etherium based distributed application to run your smart contract in a blockchain for Dapps.
## Solution provided : 
* Till now public could only transfer money to NGOs with the help of the physical currency and it is governed by the regulatory body of the country and is a centralized network. We came up with the new innovative idea, with the help of this system, you can now transfer cryptocurrency to NGOs with ease, and it's a more secure way of payment as each transaction is in a blockchain and store the data in encrypted form, also the data are immutable.
